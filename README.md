# 💰 Cryptocurrency Project

Welcome to the **Cryptocurrency** repository! This project is designed to explore, develop, and test various cryptocurrency-related functionalities, including price tracking and data analysis.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Real-time Price Tracking**: Monitor live cryptocurrency prices using APIs like CoinGecko or Binance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js
- **APIs**: CoinGecko, Binance API, or other market data sources
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite for storing historical data
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap for a responsive design
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly for data analysis and visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pip (Python package manager)**
- **Git**

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sasan-sohrabi/cryptocurrency.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cryptocurrency
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies**:
   Install Python packages from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up API keys**:
   Add your API keys (e.g., from Binance or CoinGecko) to the project configuration:
   - Create a `.env` file with your API credentials:
     ```
     API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
     ```

5. **Run the project**:
   Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## 💡 Usage

- **Price Tracking**: Fetch real-time price data for selected cryptocurrencies.

## 📊 Features to Implement

- **Price Alerts**: Set alerts when the price of a cryptocurrency hits a specified value.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **API Security**: Make sure to keep your API keys secret by using environment variables.
- **Encryption**: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user credentials) securely.
